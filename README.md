# Welcome to 'Columns'

This project accepts words from a user and sorts the words alphabetically into four columns, vertically,
then horizontally. The last row should be the only row that contains any empty cells if the number of words are not
evenly divisible by 4.

## Run it!

Run `ng serve` to sort your words. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
